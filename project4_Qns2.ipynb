    "## QUESTION 2: Factors that distinguish job category\n",
    "Using the job postings you scraped for part 1 (or potentially new job postings from a second round of scraping), identify features in the data related to job postings that can distinguish job titles from each other. There are a variety of interesting ways you can frame the target variable, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "-What components of a job posting distinguish data scientists from other data jobs?\n",
    "\n",
    "-What features are important for distinguishing junior vs. senior positions?\n",
    "\n",
    "-Do the requirements for titles vary significantly with industry (e.g. healthcare vs. government)?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may end up making multiple classification models to tackle different questions. Be sure to clearly explain your hypotheses and framing, any feature engineering, and what your target variables are. The type of classification model you choose is up to you. Be sure to interpret your results and evaluate your models' performance."
