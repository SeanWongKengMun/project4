    "## QUESTION 1: Factors that impact salary\n",
    "To predict salary you will be building either a classification or regression model, using features like the location, title, and summary of the job. If framing this as a regression problem, you will be estimating the listed salary amounts. You may instead choose to frame this as a classification problem, in which case you will create labels from these salaries (high vs. low salary, for example) according to thresholds (such as median salary).\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned a variety of new skills and models that may be useful for this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "-NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "-Unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, clustering)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Ensemble methods and decision tree models\n",
    "\n",
    "-SVM models\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever you decide to use, the most important thing is to justify your choices and interpret your results. Communication of your process is key. Note that most listings DO NOT come with salary information. You'll need to able to extrapolate or predict the expected salaries for these listings."
